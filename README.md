Hello everyone!!,
This C code implements a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user selects an option (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors).
The program then randomly selects an option for the computer.
Graphics representing the choices are displayed using ASCII art.
The game outcome (win, lose, or tie) is determined based on the user's and computer's choices.
Switch-case statements handle user and computer selections, while `srand` and `rand` functions ensure randomness.
The game result is displayed after comparing choices, indicating if the user wins, loses, or ties.
Basic input validation is implemented to handle invalid user choices.
Overall, it provides a fun and interactive experience with minimal code complexity.
